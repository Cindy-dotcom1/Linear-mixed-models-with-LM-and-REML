# Linear-mixed-models-with-LM-and-REML

This repository contains Python and R code to perform a linear mixed model regression with maximum likelihood and restrained maximum likelihood estimations.

In the repository, you will find 3 folders :

The first one, named "Beamer", contains a source code from overleaf and the pdf version of this source code. This is an abstract of the comparison between ML and REML methods.
The second one, name "Code", contains a .py file with all the Python code I used and a html file with the R code, the Python code and the results of these codes.
The last folder contains an article that details all of the project and the conclusions.
